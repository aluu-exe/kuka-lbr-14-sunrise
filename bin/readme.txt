Installation:
Move the folders into your Sunrise workspace.
There are three different applications:
> PRC_RunXML.java allows you to run an XML file generated by KUKA|prc - set the code generation to Sunrise. SRC/KRL files will not work.
> PRC_RunUDP.java allows you to send and receive data from the KUKA|prc Sunrise Communicator component. It supports several movement types and IO operations.
> PRC_RunSmartServo.java allows you to send realtime motions from the KUKA|prc Sunrise Communicator component. It only supports LIN movements (but should be easily customizable to support more movements) and requires the SmartServo software package.

You will need to adapt each file to your setup, by setting the right tool, TCP, base, and IO names.
